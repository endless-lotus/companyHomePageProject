         <article>
            <h2>How We Started</h2>
            <p>As three best friends we always loved going out and spending time together. We especially wanted to create a place where people could come together, 
                spend time, and feel comfortable in their ever bustling lives. So we found a place we too could slow down
                and decided to set up shop! <br> Ever since 2016 we have been brewing coffee at the heart of Pikes Place.
                Welcoming guests near and far a place to rest for a solem minutes and enjoy the coffee we all 
                enjoy together. Though this journey sounds easy it did have its trials and luckliy we all had eachother.</p>
